# Are My Add-Ins Safe? #

I would like to address this with questions people actually ask themselves when downloading a PowerPoint add-in.

❓ Are you trying to infect my system, steal my information, or do anything harmful?

- Absolutely not. My add‑ins exist for one purpose: to help people create better PowerPoint projects.
- If you want proof of my intentions, check out my activity on (Reddit)[https://www.reddit.com/user/ChecklistAnimations/] - you'll see hundreds of posts and replies helping users, answering questions, and building tools for the community.
❓ Why should I trust you?

- My work is public. Every add‑in lives in a GitHub repository with its source code available for anyone to inspect.
- I've built a reputation in the PowerPoint animation and design community by being transparent, consistent, and genuinely helpful.
- I don’t hide behind locked binaries — I show my work.
❓ What exactly is an add‑in?

- These are VBA‑based tools that extend PowerPoint's capabilities.
- They don't install drivers, modify your system, or run outside of Office.
- They're essentially macros packaged in a convenient format.
❓ Can VBA add‑ins be dangerous in general?

- Yes — any macro can be dangerous if written with bad intent.
- That's why I publish everything on GitHub, so you can see exactly what the code does before you install it.
❓ Where do your add‑ins come from?

- Every add‑in is built by me, tested by me, and released through GitHub.
- I don't use installers, third‑party hosting, or anything that could hide what's inside.
❓ Can I review the code myself?

- Absolutely. Each repository contains the full source code, plus short and long explanations of what the tool does.
- If you're curious or cautious, you can read through the code before downloading the PPAM.
❓ What if I'm still unsure?

- Each add‑in includes a help file and a walkthrough showing installation and usage.
- You can also reach out on Reddit or GitHub Issues — I'm always happy to answer questions.
