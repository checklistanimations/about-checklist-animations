# About Checklist Animations
Welcome to the About Me page. I had a google site with some information but honestly.... People come to my github for tools so it makes the most sense to post all stuff here.

The fact that you are even here means the world to me. I make these add-ins to help people. To shatter boundries that software has. To push the envelope.  Your use of these add-ins makes my day.
If you want to know more about why I do this. What I use and many other things read on with the links below.


Thank you again for checking out the behind the scenes of my work. Means a lot... really.
