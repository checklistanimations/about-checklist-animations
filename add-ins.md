# Add Ins #

Oh yeah now were into some of the good reading with lots of details (watches users click back button and close browser windows)

Oh. Well if you are still here then... Thank You. For caring about these tools and what I have planned it's awesome. You should contact me to let me know you read this heck
I might even try to make a custom add-in just for you or point to one that does what you need.

Ok onto the Add-Ins that are currently being developed or the concept is in the pipelnie.

I strive to make these Add-Ins modern. No gross looking buttons or huge userform windows that get in the way. Concise, Accessibile, and Visually Pleasing. That is what I go for.
It takes more code to have something as simple as making a button highlight when it sees your mouse but you are worth it. I want my tools to be a nice experience.

Point Map: Short Story: The ability to Edit Points on shapes the way you have always wanted to. Move multiple points at once and even move the points with your keyboard. This functionality has never been available before until now.Download Point Map Long Story:  Have you ever put a shape in PowerPoint, right clicked, selected the option "Edit Points", and then clicked those tiny squares while painfully dragging the point and trying desperately to keep the shape uniform? You're thinking: "Why cant I hold shift to maintain the axis?" or "Can I really not select multiple points still?" or my favorite "I really need to move this point just a freakin' pixel. Why can't I just select the point and use my arrow keys?"
I was also asking these questions and knew I would need to edit lots of freeforms.  Through years of trial and error. (started this idea over 3 years ago) I came up with a revolutionary way to edit the points of a shape and give you nearly FULL CONTROL.You now have Point Map, a groundbreaking PowerPoint Add-In developed to provide traditional drawing tools found in other software. Originally designed to aid in redrawing and refining shapes for traditional animation, Point Map has evolved into an essential tool for simplifying and streamlining the editing of freeforms and shapes.
Why Is It Better Than Edit Points?Great question! First off you can move multiple nodes simultaneously just like in other design software.I was feeling generous and you can Edit Points on multiple shapes at once.I even let you change what the points look like so you can easily select them.You can also hide the whole thing so you can see what the actual shape will look like without all those boxes like in Edit Points.
Also....  Those points and having to drag them around with the mouse... Yeah my Add-In will let you move them with your Arrow Keys. You finally have the complete precision you have always wanted. You have as much control over these points as you have for a normal shape.
Whether you're crafting intricate animations like me, or just need to edit the shapes in your presentations the way you should have always been able to. You finally can!
