# So what is Cascade exactly?

It's an acronym. Here is what it stands for

- **C**hecklist
- **A**nimations
- **S**hape
- **C**ontrol
- **A**nd
- **D**esign
- **E**fficiency

So my add-ins have a pretty high focus on controling shapes. I don't think of my toolset as something that stays open all the time. They are just there when you need them. They fix very speciifc pain points easily and quickly.

I use these very same tools in my animations that have hundreds of shapes on each slide. They allow me to continue using PowerPoint for such a task and I wanted to share them with the community.  The definition of Cascade has a couple

- a small waterfall, typically one of several that fall in stages down a steep rocky slope. (uh yeah these always start simple and then kaboom into these fairly big tools)
- a process whereby something, typically information or knowledge, is successively passed on. (yup here it is you are welcome)
- arrange a number of devices or objects in a series or sequence. (Yes these tools are related to each other)

So yeah Cascade is all of that. My sincere hope is that it helps you in some way.
